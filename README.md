# LexGuard — A Compliance-First Agent Framework

**Goal:** Merge **predictability** (rule-based reliability) with **flexibility** (LLM adaptability) in long, multi-stage conversations — with **compliance guarantees**.

LexGuard is a small, production-minded prototype that demonstrates:
- A **policy DSL (YAML)** to declaratively encode *what an agent may/shall/must not do*
- An **interaction graph** (states + transitions) to constrain control flow
- **Guidelines** (principles) that are contextually activated to let an LLM stay natural *within* the policy envelope
- **Guards** (PII, profanity, topic, channel) that **block/redact/self-heal** violations before responses are released
- **Auditable transcripts** (JSONL) with *who, why, and which rule* influenced each turn
- A **test harness** for scenario-based regression on compliance + behavior
- A minimal **CLI** demo and optional **FastAPI** endpoint

> ✳️ **Inspiration**: Parlant's ideas around *Journeys* and *Guidelines* for agent behavior modeling and tool use informed this design. This repo shows how to attain a similar blend of **control + adaptability** with lightweight components and a transparent policy layer.

## Why this approach?
Traditional flows are brittle; pure LLM autonomy is risky. LexGuard composes:
- **Determinism** via a typed **state graph** + **policy DSL**
- **Adaptability** by letting the LLM *select among allowed* next steps and draft text, *but never outside policy*
- **Compliance** through pre- and post-LLM **guards**, automatic **redaction**, and **human-in-the-loop** gates

## Quickstart

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the CLI demo (HR onboarding example)
python examples/hr_onboarding/run_cli.py

# Optional: run a REST API
uvicorn examples.service.api:app --reload
```

> By default, a **MockLLM** is used so you can run without credentials. To try a real model, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and run with `--model openai:gpt-4o-mini` (or edit `examples/hr_onboarding/run_cli.py`).

## Highlights
- **Policy-first**: Declare norms in YAML; code enforces them.
- **Flexible text**: The LLM writes language; rules **shape** it and **veto** when needed.
- **Deterministic control**: Only **allowed transitions** are ever taken.
- **Explainability**: Each output cites which **rules**, **guards**, and **tools** applied.
- **Testability**: Run scenario tests that assert both **answers** and **compliance**.

## How it relates to Parlant
- Similarities: **Guidelines/Principles**, **Journeys (state)**, **tight tool integration**, and **alignment modeling**
- Differences: a very **lightweight, open** DSL; small **standard-library-first** runtime; and transparent guards/audits you can tailor. See `docs/Design.md` for a side-by-side and rationale.

## Demo Scenario (HR / EOR Onboarding)
A multi-stage flow with sensitive data:
1) **Greeting & Eligibility Check** → country, employment type, role  
2) **Collect PII in Secure Channel** → only after consent & channel is `secure_upload`  
3) **Contract Draft** → generate summary (never raw PII)  
4) **Approval Gate** → manager/legal confirmation required  
5) **Finalize & Next Steps** → hand-off links + checklist

Guards enforce **no PII in open chat**, **no legal promises**, and **de-escalation** to a human if uncertainty grows.
